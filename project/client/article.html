      <h2>Node.js Internals: Not Everything Happens on the Thread Pool</h2>
      <p>
        Node.js is often recognized for its non-blocking and event-driven
        architecture. But how does it manage to process various operations
        efficiently on a single thread? Let's dive into its internals.

    <!-- Section 2: The Event Loop -->
    <section class="about article-content">
      <h3>1. The Event Loop</h3>
      <p>
        At the heart of Node.js lies the <strong>Event Loop</strong>, a
        mechanism responsible for handling asynchronous operations. The event
        loop processes tasks like I/O operations, network requests, and timers
        while ensuring JavaScript code runs in a single-threaded environment.

    <!-- Section 3: Thread Pool -->
    <section class="about article-content">
      <h3>2. Thread Pool</h3>
      <p>
        For tasks requiring more time, like file system operations or
        cryptographic computations, Node.js uses a
        <strong>Thread Pool</strong> provided by <strong>libuv</strong>, a
        library that Node.js relies on for platform-specific implementations.

    <!-- Section 4: Direct OS-Level Operations -->
    <section class="about article-content">
      <h3>3. Direct OS-Level Operations</h3>
      <p>
        Not all tasks in Node.js go through the thread pool. Certain operations,
        such as networking tasks (handled via OS kernel mechanisms), bypass the
        thread pool altogether. This is why Node.js can efficiently manage
        multiple simultaneous requests.

      <h3>4. Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding Node.js internals helps developers write optimized code
        and avoid common pitfalls, such as blocking the event loop with heavy
        computations.

    <!-- Section 6: Conclusion -->
    <section class="about article-content">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Node.js is a powerful runtime that combines the speed of
        <strong>V8</strong>, the efficiency of <strong>libuv</strong>, and the
        simplicity of JavaScript. By understanding its architecture, you can
        build scalable and performant applications Great that the scrolling is
